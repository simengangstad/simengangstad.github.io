Hello and welcome to my new blog! This will mainly be a place for my opinions on different things, as well as for my projects.

This is just the usual "Hello World"-post, so I'm going to talk a bit about this site. The production of this site was fairly straight forward. I used <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. I met some complications though. For example I wanted to use the Dinky theme from Github, so I had to do some modifications with the Jekyll structure to allow that. It didn't take much to achieve this though, and in the end the results were pretty good. 

I've never been much into web development before, so most of the things in the making of this site were quite new to me. Jekyll was a bit perplexing in the start, but I love it now. Its way of having a polymorphic layout structure is very useful, and removes a lot of boilerplate code. It also has support for Markdown, which was a requirement for me in the choice of framework. It's definitely something to consider it if you want to set up a simple page like this.
