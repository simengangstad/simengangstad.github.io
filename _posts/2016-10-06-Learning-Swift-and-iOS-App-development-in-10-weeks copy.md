After a long period of time in the Java world I've decided to try to learn Swift and iOS app development (again). I wanted to learn programming 4 years ago because I fancied making apps for the iPhone. I made three apps that were published to the App Store when I was around 14/15. I took them down later though, mostly because I lost interest and didn't know in which direction to go next (Notch became my big idol suddenly and therefore I jumped on to the Java and game development train).

These apps were quite hacky, and I have to admit that I'm not that proud of them (and that's why you won't get copies either). I didn't understand the core of what I did, and I think that's another reason why I stopped. I didn't know why things were as they were, which caused friction.

Now I'm by nature far more curious, so that's one reason why I've decided to try to learn Swift and iOS App Development. I would say that I'm starting at a moderate level. I'm familiar with UIKit, Foundation and the app life cycle. What I will be learning through these weeks is therefore Swift and the new APIs in the versions since iOS 6. It'll be interesting.

I've just finished an almost year long project in Java that I'm really proud of. I might post it up here once I've tested it with a few more people and gotten more feedback. Anyway, I'm quite excited to learn something new whilst doing maintenance on my other project.

I will be going through the CS 193P iPhone Application Development course (Spring 2016) from Stanford University and blog about it here as I go. The course has got 18 lectures. I will go through 3 (or more) each week and do the assigned homework. That makes it a total 6 weeks to complete. I'll decide as I go what I will do in the remaining 4 weeks (maybe a small project?).

Wish me good luck!
