##### Done

Read the following from The Swift Programming Guide, edition 3...

From Collection Types:

* Dictionaries


From Control Flow:

* For Loops
* While Loops
* Conditional Statements
* Control Transfer Statements


From Functions:

* Defining and Calling Functions
* Function Parameters and Return Values
* Function Types
* Nested Functions


##### Reflections


*Dictionaries*
Maybe I'm a bit conservative when it comes to Dictionaries, but I don't like the idea that `dictionary[key] = nil` removes the value associated with *key* from the dictionary. It's short, I'll give it that, but I think one rather should have to use `removeValue(forKey:)`. As I understand it so far nil is *just* for setting optionals to not set, and that makes sense. This, not so much. It makes it a bit funky when one has got an dictionary with an optional key or value:

```
var dictionary = [String: String?]()
dictionary["key"] = "value"
dictionary["key"]! = nil // Sets the optional value of key "key" to nil
dictionary["key"] = nil // Removes the value asociated with "key"

```

*Switch*
I actually love that you can chain multiple cases with this syntax `case 1, 2, 3:`. It's far safer than chaining multiple cases like this:

```
case 1:
case 2:
case 3:

break;
```
... As one can have the case where one forgets the break and it falls through. In Swift there is no break and a case can't be empty, so that problem doesn't occur. If one has to fall through, one can just use the fall through keyword. Elegant and concise.


*Functions*
Functions and tuples in Swift are definitely one of my favourite parts so far. Returning tuples (and the fact that you can do tuple.nameOfVariable) is super useful for complex functions that I don't want to split into multiple ones, because they might all require the same arguments:
```
func life() -> (number: Int, string: String) {

    return (42, "The meaning of life")
}

let lifeTuple = life()
print(lifeTuple.number)
print(lifeTuple.string)
```

The fact that functions also are types makes it easy to define callbacks without having the need to write an interface for example.



I didn't have the time to watch the second lecture today, but I'll read the rest from reading assignment 1 and watch the lecture tomorrow.
