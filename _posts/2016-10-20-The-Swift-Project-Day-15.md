I've been quite busy the last two days and I've also been struggling with the second programming assignment, hence I haven't posted anything. I'm stuck at making my code flexible for variables inputted by the user (whicg are later changed).

I won't be active during the weekend as I'm on political events, but I'll try to catch up next week.
