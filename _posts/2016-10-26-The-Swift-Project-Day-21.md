##### Reflections

The fifth lecture is all about gestures and different ways of using gestures to modify the properties of a face. I had some trouble assigning the action with `#selector(FaceView.changeScale(_:))` in the `FaceViewController` (it yielded that the FaceView didn't have a member named that). Changing it to `#selector(FaceView.changeScale)` fixed it. The gif is just basic demonstrations of pinch, tap and pan gestures.

`@IBDesignable` and `@IBInspectable` are so useful. With `@IBInspectable` is kind of like Unity where you can set variables in the inspector rather than in the code. Super neat for quick adjustments!
