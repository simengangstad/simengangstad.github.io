##### Done

Watched the eight lecture.


##### Reflections

Lots of interesting stuff on multithreading and making the UI responsive for the Cassini app in this lecture.  The use of dispatch queues are a bit different in Swift 3.x than in Swift 2.x, as the API is encapsulated into `DispatchQueue`. <a href="http://swiftable.io/2016/06/dispatch-queues-swift-3/" target="_blank">This article</a> explains how the API is in Swift 3.x very well.  I've now caught up with my schedule. Next programming assignment will be set for next lecture (which will be on Sunday), but I'll watch ahead to gain some time.



The updated code is <a href="https://github.com/simengangstad/The-Swift-Project" target="_blank">here</a>
