##### Done

Watched the eleventh lecture.

##### Reflections

I ran into some problems despite my optimistic assumptions yesterday. The Core Data API is a bit different in iOS 10 than previous versions. The `NSManagedObjectContext` is accessed through the AppDelegateâ€™s `persistentContainer.viewContext` instead of the property `managedObjectContext` for example. I also had some problems casting my subclasses of `NSManagedObject`. It got fixed when I deleted the app from the simulator, which is quite peculiar. It does however correspond to my previous experiences with Core Data :P
