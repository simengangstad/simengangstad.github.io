![breakOut]({{ site.url }}/resources/breakout-day50.gif)

Sorry for the lack of updates, I've been quite busy and I've been struggling with the assignment. I've gotten to a point now where the break out game works, but you can't really lose as I can't figure out how to set the collider behavior to react to just boundaries and items, not everything in the view and the bounds of the view itself. The push behavior is also quite troublesome as I can't get it to change push direction for some reason. This and many more problems have made me let it be for now and go on with the lectures. I'll come back to it later.

The updated code is <a href="https://github.com/simengangstad/The-Swift-Project" target="_blank">here</a>
