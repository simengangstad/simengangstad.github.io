##### Done

Watched the sixteenth lecture.

##### Reflections

I’ve not done much work with `NSNotificationCenter` before; I had no clue it was as powerful as it is. I’m also intrigued that CloudKit seems to be quite easy to implement.

I’m gonna try to watch the last two lecture tomorrow and the day after tomorrow so I’ll have at least two weeks to build a prototype for my final project.
