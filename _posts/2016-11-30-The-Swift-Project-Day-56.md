##### Done

Watched the seventeenth lecture.

##### Reflections

Lecture seventeen is about segues and MapKit. I've decided to use MapKit for my "final project", and of the things I've seen it seems to be easy to implement those map aspects of the app. I do need to figure out how to select countries and outline them though.
