Well, this is the last day of The Swift Project. I'm quite proud that I’ve managed to finish the course and learn so much of Swift and the iOS SDK on the way. I've been trying to put something together for a final project, but I'm not finished with it yet as due to being busy with school and work. My idea is an app where you can ask questions to a specific country and then have them answered by the population of that country. Think of it like a version of reddit where there are subreddits for each nation. The idea behind this was to break barriers between countries for a period of time where we seem to isolate ourselves even more and more.

I’ll keep you guys updated on the progress with the app!
