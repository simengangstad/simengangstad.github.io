##### Done

Watched the eighteenth lecture.

##### Reflections

This lecture demonstrates different segues and how to make popovers work on iPad. It also shows how to make the presentation style adapt to an iPhone environment. With that I'm done with the course, wohoo! Now I'll spend the last 12 days working on my final project. It'll be exciting to see how much I've learnt and how I can adapt it!
