So it's been a long time since I've posted anything here, but here comes a big update. The game I've been working on is finally in beta! It's called Dungeon Defence (<a href="resources/Dungeon Defence beta 002.jar" target="_blank">download</a>, you'll need Java 1.8 installed and at least OpenGL 2.1) and is a roguelike survival game. The goal is to survive as many waves of enemies as you can. Think of it like a 2D Call Of Duty: Zombies situated in a procedural cave where you can mine and craft. You've got 1 minute at the start before the waves arrive, and 1 minute between the waves to explore and prepare yourself for the next wave. It has now reached a state where it's more or less playable and fun, so that's why I'm releasing it. I don't have any ambitions of selling it, as the whole project was a challenge I set to myself to see what I can achieve in terms of game development. Therefore will you find the <a href="https://github.com/simengangstad/Dungeon-Defence" target="_blank">code</a> on Github if you want to see how it's built. Have fun!

The other thing I've been working on is the project I started after The Swift Project. It's an app where you represent your country and you can ask questions to other countries in order to learn more about their culture (a full description is in the blog post below). I've gotten quite far, and I think I'll release it on the App Store soon, it just needs to be tested thoroughly. It has taken a few months because I've been really busy with school, but I imagine I'll pick up the pace in the following weeks.

I've learnt so much from the project though, as it has basically been the creation of a miniature social network on CloudKit. It has been challenging setting up a good system for everything that can go wrong when working with the cloud, but I think I've got it now, and that is extremely satisfying.

I'm gonna post weekly updates from now in order to force myself to work on it, as well as documenting the progress it properly.
