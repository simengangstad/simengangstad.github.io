&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome to my new blog! This will mainly be a place for my opinions on different things, as well as for my projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the usual “Hello World”-post, so I’m going to talk a bit about this site. The production of this site was fairly straight forward. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. I met some complications though. For example I wanted to use the Dinky theme from Github, so I had to do some modifications with the Jekyll structure to allow that. It didn’t take much to achieve this though, and in the end the results were pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been much into web development before, so most of the things in the making of this site were quite new to me. Jekyll was a bit perplexing in the start, but I love it now. Its way of having a polymorphic layout structure is very useful, and removes a lot of boilerplate code. It also has support for Markdown, which was a requirement for me in the choice of framework. It’s definitely something to consider it if you want to set up a simple page like this.&lt;/p&gt;
