#  Privacy policy

This policy applies to all data in relation with Moments for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

Moments is a Freemium app (it has in-app purchases). The app is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page
provides visitors information regarding policies with the data Moments use in order to provide its services.


## Your data

We do **not** collect any user data. All your data is stored in iCloud in relation with your personal account. A cache of the
recent entries are stored locally in order to decrease load time within the app.


## Technical basics

Moments has an authentication feature which relies on Apple's [Local Authentication API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/localauthentication/lacontext). Thus, **your biometric data or passcode is never exposed to Moments**. It's all handled internally on-device by Apple's API.

For remote updates in-app between iCloud and your device, we store a server and change token on the device. This is
only to make sure that Moments can update your local cache with the data in your personal iCloud.


## Information usage

We **do not** share personal information with outside parties.


## Data control

You may at any time erase all data you've created within Moments in the settings page.


## International Transfers of Data

Your data may be processed and stored outside of the country in which you are located (on Apple's iCloud servers). Data privacy
laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored,
or used.


## Your Consent

By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.


## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email <simen.gangstad@me.com>.


## Changes to this policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:
