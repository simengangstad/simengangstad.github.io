### **Projects**

This is a game I made for my final project in Technology and Theory of Research (a school subject). The goal was to make a game which learned students mathematical functions. I later did some research with this game on 7th grade students and the result were quite good. Mind that this game has Norwegian text.

A game I made for the 29th Ludum Dare where the theme was "Beneath the surface". I wanted to make a dark rogue-like game and ended up with something a bit close. I didn't have the time (nor the knowledge at that time) to make a system with procedurally generated levels, so I made a pre-made map with a lot of different spawn points. In that way the level would seem more random at least. The AI is very poor and the art isn't that good either, but I was pretty satisfied with the result in the end. If you're on Mac you need to right click and then click open to run it.
