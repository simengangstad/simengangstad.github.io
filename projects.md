### **Projects**

<a href="https://github.com/AscendNTNU/fluid" target="_blank"><i>Fluid Finite State Machine</i></a>
<br>
A finite state machine I made for <a href="https://www.ascendntnu.no" target="_blank">Ascend NTNU</a> (NTNU's aerial robotics student team). It is built around PX4 and MAVROS for autonomous flight of drones with the Pixhawk flight controller. Each year, Ascend NTNU competes in complex drone autonomy competitions against other student teams. It was a thrill making this FSM and seeing it work in the competitions we participated in.

<a href="https://github.com/simengangstad/SwiftyCloudKit" target="_blank"><i>SwiftyCloudKit</i></a>
<br>
A thin layer written on top of Cloud Kit in order to make it easy to add cloud kit capabilities to iOS and tvOS apps. 

<a href="resources/Dungeon Defence beta 002.jar" target="_blank"><i>Dungeon Defence</i></a>
<br>
A roguelike survival game written in Java with libGDX, where the objective is to explore a cave system, mine, craft items and fight off waves of enemies. I made this game during 2016 and it's one of the bigger games I've completed to a playable state. The game is available as open source on my <a href="https://github.com/simengangstad/Dungeon-Defence" target="_blank"><i>Github</i></a>.

<a href="https://github.com/simengangstad/arm-emulator" target="_blank"><i>ARM emulator</i></a>
<br>
A simple ARM emulator written in Python for a project in AS-level Computer Science. The goal was to show the different stages of the fetch-decode-execute cycle. It was designed mainly for education, as a practical way to learn how the CPU works in basic aspects. Please contact me if you decide to use this in your classroom or if you have any questions about the code.

<a href="https://github.com/simengangstad/cpu" target="_blank"><i>Virtual CPU</i></a>
<br>
A virtual CPU written in Java with it's own assembly language. It's quite flexible, but far from finished. The vision of this project was to create a terminal that could be used in a game (inspired by Notch's DCPU). I'd love if someone found use in this project as it has got some potential. Please contact me if you have questions about this project or if you use it in one our your own projects; I'm more than willing to help.

<a href="http://simengangstad.github.io/pipi" target="_blank"><i>Pipi</i></a>
<br>
This is a game I made for my final project in Technology and Theory of Research, written in Dart. The goal was to make a game which learned students mathematical functions. I later did some research with this game on 7th grade students and the result were quite good. Mind that this game has got Norwegian text.

<a href="resources/LD29 - Return To The Surface.jar"><i>Return to the Surface</i></a>
<br>
A game I made for the 29th Ludum Dare Compo (48 hours to make a game based on a theme) where the theme was "Beneath the surface". I wanted to make a dark roguelike game and ended up with something a bit close. I didn't have the time (nor the knowledge at that time) to make a system with procedurally generated levels, so I made a pre-made map with a lot of different spawn points. In that way the level would seem more random at least. The AI is very poor and the art isn't that good either, but I was pretty satisfied with the result in the end. If you're on Mac you need to right click and then click open to run it.
